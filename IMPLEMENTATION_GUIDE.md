# PrivAds Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Project Summary

You've designed a **privacy-preserving advertising system** that learns user preferences from behavioral signals alone (clicks) and matches them with semantically-rich ad embeddings. This is a sophisticated multi-modal learning problem that bridges textual understanding (ads) with behavioral patterns (users).

## 🔄 Training Pipeline Flow

### Stage 1: Data Preparation
```python
# Generate synthetic data (or load real data)
python generate_data.py
# → Creates data/train_clicks.csv with (user_id, ad_id, ad_text, clicked)
```

### Stage 2: Triplet Mining
```python
# From click data, build co-click graph
processor = ClickDataProcessor(click_data)

# For each user (anchor):
#   - Positive: user who clicked same ads
#   - Negative: user who clicked different ads
triplets = processor.generate_triplets(strategy='hard')
```

### Stage 3: Model Training
```python
# Forward pass
ad_projected = projector(ad_encoder(ad_text))     # Ad → user space
user_emb = user_embedding_table[user_id]

# Loss 1: Click prediction (alignment)
similarity = cosine_sim(ad_projected, user_emb)
L_click = BCE(similarity, clicked_label)

# Loss 2: User contrastive (structure)
L_triplet = max(0, ||u_a - u_p||² - ||u_a - u_n||² + margin)

# Combined
L_total = L_click + λ * L_triplet
```

### Stage 4: Evaluation
```python
# Ranking metrics
python inference.py --checkpoint checkpoints/best_model.pt --test-data data/test_clicks.csv

# Outputs:
# - Precision@K, Recall@K, NDCG@K, MRR
# - Similarity separation (clicked vs non-clicked)
# - User embedding statistics
```

## 🧠 Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Why Two Separate Embedding Spaces?**

**Problem**: Ads have textual features; users don't.

**Solution**: Learn two spaces with different supervision:
- **Ad space**: Semantic similarity (text-based)
- **User space**: Behavioral similarity (click-based)

**Projector** aligns them so we can compare across modalities.

### 2. **Why Contrastive Learning for Users?**

Without textual features, we need to learn from user relationships:
- Users who click **same ads** → should be **similar**
- Users who click **different ads** → should be **dissimilar**

This is exactly what triplet/contrastive loss does!

### 3. **Why Not Train End-to-End from Scratch?**

**Advantages of pre-trained ad encoder**:
- Transfer learning from billions of text pairs
- Faster convergence
- Better generalization to new ad text

**Only train**:
- User embeddings (no pre-training possible)
- Projector (learned alignment)

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Commands)

```bash
# 1. Setup
./quickstart.sh

# 2. Train (or let quickstart.sh do it)
python train.py --data data/train_clicks.csv --num-users 5000 --epochs 20 --use-triplets

# 3. Evaluate
python inference.py --checkpoint checkpoints/best_model.pt --test-data data/test_clicks.csv --num-users 5000
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### Typical Metrics (Synthetic Data)

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Accuracy** | 75-85% | Binary click prediction |
| **Precision@10** | 0.25-0.35 | 25-35% of top-10 are clicked |
| **NDCG@10** | 0.45-0.55 | Ranking quality |
| **MRR** | 0.30-0.40 | First relevant in top-3 on avg |
| **Separation** | 0.3-0.5 | Clicked pairs 0.3-0.5 more similar |

### Training Progress
```
Epoch 1:  Loss=0.6543 (Click: 0.6234, Triplet: 0.0618)
Epoch 10: Loss=0.3892 (Click: 0.3521, Triplet: 0.0371)
Epoch 20: Loss=0.3214 (Click: 0.2987, Triplet: 0.0227)
```

Healthy training: Both losses decrease, separation increases.

## 🔬 Next Steps & Extensions

### Immediate Improvements
1. **Hard Negative Mining**: Sample hard negatives more strategically
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search for margin, temperature, λ
3. **Curriculum Learning**: Start with easy triplets, increase difficulty

### Advanced Features
4. **Temporal Dynamics**: User preferences change over time
   - Add recurrent component to user embeddings
   - Weight recent clicks more heavily

5. **Multi-Task Learning**: 
   - Joint prediction of clicks + conversions + time-spent
   - Auxiliary task: predict ad category from embedding

6. **Hierarchical User Modeling**:
   - User clusters → individual users
   - Helps with cold-start (new users start at cluster center)

7. **Contextual Information**:
   - Add time-of-day, device, location (if privacy-preserving)
   - Context embeddings concatenated with user embeddings

### Privacy Enhancements
8. **Differential Privacy**: Add noise to gradients (via Opacus)
9. **Federated Learning**: Users compute embeddings on-device
10. **Secure Multi-Party Computation**: Match users to ads without revealing embeddings

### Production Deployment
11. **Vector Database**: Faiss/Milvus for fast similarity search
12. **Model Serving**: FastAPI endpoint with ONNX runtime
13. **A/B Testing**: Compare against baseline (collaborative filtering, popularity)
14. **Monitoring**: Track CTR, diversity, coverage over time

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: User embeddings not converging
**Solutions**:
- Increase triplet loss weight (λ)
- Use harder negatives
- Check that users have enough clicks (≥5)
- Reduce user embedding dimension

### Problem: Click prediction poor
**Solutions**:
- Decrease triplet loss weight (prioritize alignment)
- Fine-tune ad encoder (unfreeze)
- Check data quality (CTR too low? Imbalanced?)

### Problem: Cold-start users perform poorly
**Solutions**:
- Use mean user embedding as default
- Implement fast adaptation (few-shot learning)
- Increase exploration (contextual bandits)
